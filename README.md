This code is not intended for recreation.

In July 2021, there was an anniversary event on Roblox's Loomian Legacy. This event added tedious tasks that gave you valuable items after awhile. In my infinte knowledge, I decided that that stinks and I would program something to do this overnight.

That initial program and many others were coded in Notepad++ which were eventually lost to a harddrive corruption. This program was developed months later when another coveted game introduced a grind intensive item. This program is a higher sophistication than its former. As opposed to just clicking locations on the screen, this now also controls your character to navigate through a lobby from multiple different potential spawning locations to an elevator. It then does some preprogrammed tower placements depending on the map it loaded into, then returns to the lobby when the round is lost and starts over.

This program is my first experience fiddling with System-hook git repo to replicate keyboard inputs.
